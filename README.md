# StatesQuiz
US States quiz app for Android

This is my final project for Udacity's "Grow With Google Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics" course. I tried to use as many of the Android layout ideas, and Java concepts, that I learned from this course, and then some. This includes:

* Multiple Activities
* Using Intents to pass data around between Activities
* Multiple Views: Relative/Linear layout, TextView, EditText, ImageView, CheckBox, Spinner, Button, RadioButton, RadioGroup
* Persisting data through a configuration change (screen rotation) with onSaveInstanceState and onRestoreInstanceState
* Java data types: boolean, int, String, array of Strings
* String manipulation: concatenation, substring, toUpperCase, toLowerCase, split, append, length, equals
* 2x2 grouping of RadioButtons, and handling what is checked between the two
* Using custom drawable resources and loading them in ImageView
* Showing, hiding, changing the text, and manipulating the style of various Views in the app
* Inserting a delay with Handler postDelayed and Runnable
* javadoc comment style of class methods
* Toast
